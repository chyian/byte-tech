                            <p>eSports is still considered a niche industry dealing with a very specific fan base. This can make it hard for marketers, with or without a previous understanding of the industry, to break in and establish themselves. This consumer base has very focused interests as well as preferences, which makes it challenging for marketers new to the game.</p>
<p>Recently, Buffalo Wild Wings paired with ELEAGUE, a video game tournament broadcasted on TBS. They invited fans to enjoy the tournament at any of their 1,175 locations. However, when ELEAGUE fans showed up, the chain’s employees were unfamiliar with the tournament and would only show the tournament on a handful of televisions (out of many!) even after many complaints.</p>
<p>The fans complained that the employees referred to their fandom as a bunch of “nerds.” This clearly is an example of a brand entering the marketing arena of eSports with little to no knowledge of the industry and failing to increase their own brand loyalty and profits.

                            <p>The eSports industry is already an over $1 Billion dollar market. It’s no wonder why brands are concerned about how much of that money is being spent by underage participants. This is a growing issue with younger players abusing their parents’ credit cards and spending thousands of dollars on tournaments, whether it’s on merchandise, gambling, games, and more. This can be an issue for marketers as well, by being associated with tournaments that have a lack of security and monitoring capability. It can also be tied with an issue of the brand selling their products and their overall business moral.
If a consumer, especially if that consumer is underage, is using someone else’s money to buy products due to the marketing campaign associated with an eSports tournament it can provide that brand with an ethical issue as well as a business issue. They might have to return the sold products, resulting in a loss of profit and the loss of the potential return of that consumer.

                            <p>eSports is still a relatively new industry which means that it’s going to have its own growing pains. For instance, a lot of participants and players complain that some of the tournaments lack authenticity, and thus it can be challenging to find which tournaments are real and which one is full of scams. This places issues for marketers as well, especially ones with a role in active sports marketing but who have no experience in the eSports market.</p><p>
The lack of standardization in this industry also means that there are constant issues that arise with players, teams, tournaments and their advertising, sponsorships or contracts. For instance, salaries for players remain remarkably low for novice and immediate levels despite their necessary involvement within the tournaments. There are also continuous issues with poorly crafted contracts between brands and teams or players that usually result in a nasty lawsuit or poor player performance, which naturally negatively affects brands and their marketing teams. These growing pains currently plague the entire eSports industry but will likely (hopefully) be ironed out as this industry continues to expand.

                            <p>This global phenomenon of eSports is unlike other market segments that brands are trying to break into. Therefore, it may not be apparent that success as a marketer will come quickly. While this still-niche industry is full of passionate people who love challenges and gaming, it’s unclear how much sway brands have with their marketing efforts. However – if brands do it right – this is a consumer base created to escalate brand loyalty. The trick is finding relevant messages and products and offerings that meet the consumer habits and enhance the eSports ecosystem.

                            <p>The video game company, “Nexon”, is the company that accidentally created the “Loot Box”. Essentially, it includes a gambling element, requiring staking bets or investment of money to have the probability of acquiring an in-game product or item that either may have a game-changing feature, or commonly an aesthetic. It was used as a new way to get the players to spend more on in-game products. This is notably used by EA in their faulty description, “surprise mechanics” in which EA was made to appear before several national legislative committees to testify their abuse of the system.
