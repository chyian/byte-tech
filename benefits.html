A study found that people who, especially FPS, had a better perception of colour contrast.  Gaming helps players become more responsive to different shades of colour.

                            <p>E-sports has shown that gaming is unique in its requirements for hand-eye coordination. Almost every sport requires it. What makes gaming and esports unique is the requirement for asymmetrical hand-eye coordination.<br>
This means that professional gamers need to be able to do different actions with each hand simultaneously. The mouse and the keyboard require two different actions but must be coordinated. In console gaming, each hand is performing different actions. In fact, Professor Ingo Froböse’s research on esports athletes found that the needed hand-eye coordination went far beyond that required for table tennis. All hand-eye coordination must synch perfectly to what is happening in front of the gamer on the screen often happening at extremely fast-paced rates. Most competitive gamers started gaming at a young age and have perfected the required hand-eye coordination, reaction timing and muscle memory over many years.<br><br>
An interesting study looked at surgeons who played video games (more specific to the Wii). The findings show that surgeons who played video games improved their hand-eye coordination and the precise muscle movements necessary for surgery. THis can also be therapeutic to some people with mental or physical illnesses that as a result need a form of therapy without going through intensive measures.

                            <h1>Critical Thinking</h1>
                            <p>Gaming, especially competitive gaming and esports, requires players to take in mass amounts of information, process and analyze it, then make split-second decisions, over and over. Competitive gaming is like chess on overdrive. Gaming requires you to think about what your opponent is thinking about, and even to think about what you think your opponent is thinking that you’re thinking about. Once you’ve taken in the presented information, processed and analyzed it, you need to then react with what you think the most logical next step should be. Often, this logical reaction needs to happen in a split second, and many of these decisions become instinctual for players. The ability to take in and process large amounts of information and make split-second logical decisions is going to become more and more of an invaluable skill. Lots of people take in large amounts of information and think about it, but what can separate gamers, is that they take action.<br><br>
Critical thinking is an important eSports skill, as repetitive gathering, processing and analysing of information is required to make a good decision. This then also requires you to strategise, and think in terms of the enemy or for allies alike, You must then need to take the next appropriate course of action, in a mere split second decision. It has become nearly instinctive for many players and makes them distinctive for their initiative of action.

                            <p>As we age, we start to see a decline in our: cognitive flexibility, attention, working memory, abstract reasoning<br>
Experiments were done with elderly patients and showed that gaming resulted in improvements to all of the above. One study found that on top of the above benefits, enhanced life qualities such as a better self-concept were experienced by the participants. It’s not enough to know your own character in Overwatch or champion in LoL, you need to know it all. Having to exercise and use your memory as you do with competitive gaming is again like “practice makes perfect”; the more you commit things to memory, the better you’ll get at it.<br><br>
Ageing decreases our cognition, attention, memory and reasoning abilities/skills. Many experiments show that gaming improves these skills to elderly patients, added to it are better improvements to qualities, like self-concept being felt by the patients. As with League of Legends, or Overwatch, it requires you to know what all the “heroes” or characters does in-game. This “knowing” requires memory and will help you get better at the memory department.

</h1>
                            <p>eSports scholarships exist. They come in varying amounts financially, but they often mean you are an athlete on a college varsity sports team. The amount of schools offering esports scholarships has grown rapidly over just a few years and it doesn’t seem to be slowing down. As it grew over the last couple of decades, people kept saying it was a fad or that it’s not a real sport. Sure, esports may never be as big as some of the more traditional sports, but there aren’t many colleges offering scholarships for darts or billiards.<br><br>
Schools offering scholarships for eSports players do exist and have grown quite fast recently. This further solidifies the position of eSports being recognised as a sport in its own right. These scholarships vary financially

                            <p>Having a passion for esports and competitive gaming doesn’t mean you have to work toward the goal of becoming a professional gamer. Esports is an industry, and industries require many hands behind the scenes. Here’s a list of potential employment opportunities in esports:
<br>-Social media manager<br>
-Event manager<br>
-Agent<br>
-Sponsor<br>
-Streamer<br>
-Host<br>
-Coach<br>
-Journalist<br>
-Sales and marketing specialist<br>
-Referee<br>
-Organization owner<br><br>
Having the experience of competitive gaming under your belt will help give you an edge when exploring other opportunities in esports. You will have not only networked with other people in the industry, but you’ll have gained a fundamental understanding of what it means to be inside esports, as opposed to outside looking in, and employers will appreciate this perspective<br><br>
Behind the face of the gaming aspect of eSports, are the behind-the-scenes elements of it. eSports itself is an industry, thus requiring staffs or men-on-deck to keep its state going. Among the jobs essential to a game or a match are, social media and event managers, sponsors, hosts, coaches, journalists, referee, marketing, etc. Being a gamer allows you to have another avenue to opportunities in eSports. It gives you pass to be the and have insights into the organs of eSports, not just an insider.
